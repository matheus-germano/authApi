# JWT Authentication API
 A Rest API developed for study purposes where you can create an user and authenticate it using NodeJS and JWT.
 
 This project was made following the steps from this tutorial, created by Dev Ed, who I like and recommend so much: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jqok-WgelI
 
 To develop that, I used:
 - Express, to create the routes and middlewares;
 - Nodemon, to auto-reload the server;
 - Joi, to validate fields data;
 - bcryptjs, to hash the user's password and make the application more secure;
 - MongoDB, to storage the data and Mongoose to do the connection;
 - JWT, to authenticate users.

This is pretty basic and has a lot to improve, but it's my first Authentication API, it's just de beginning üòÅ
